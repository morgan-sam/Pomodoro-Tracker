<h3>About</h3>

<p>The pomodoro technique is great way to maintain productivity.</p>
<p>However most pomodoro apps are only good while the timer is on.</p>
<p>As soon as the timer goes off? Unnecessarily loud distracting sounds, overlays that fill the screen blocking your work, unchangeable timer/break periods, losing the window to reset the timer, losing track of the total pomodoro count, pomodoro count not syncing across workstations... the list goes on.</p>
<p>This pomodoro tracker makes a few slight changes for a massive improvement in productivity:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No loud noises. Small, silent notification at the top of the screen.</li>
  <li>Script that maps to a keyboard shortcut. Reset timer with a keystroke.</li>
  <li>Portable. Download the script in a second and be up and running.</li>
  <li>Pomodoro count stored in a centralised database. Always in sync.</li>
  <li>View pomodoro timeline/graph/stats online. Easily visualise your productivity level.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result? The time between you finishing a pomodoro and going onto the next one is reduced to negligible.</p>
<p>A notification pops up at the top the screen.</p>
<p>You hit the keyboard shortcut.</p>
<p>You're back in the zone.</p>
<p>The focus on your work is unbroken.</p>
